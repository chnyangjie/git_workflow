# Gitflow Workflow

The Gitflow Workflow section below is derived from Vincent Driessen at nvie.

The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. While somewhat more complicated than the [Feature Branch Workflow](../feature_branch_workflow), this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases. Of course, you also get to leverage all the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow: pull requests, isolated experiments, and more efficient collaboration.
