# Where To Go From Here

By now, you’re hopefully quite comfortable with the [Centralized Workflow](../centralized_workflow/), the [Feature Branch Workflow](../feature_branch_workflow/), and the [Gitflow Workflow](../gitflow_workflow/). You should also have a solid grasp on the potential of local repositories, the push/pull pattern, and Git's robust branching and merging model.

Remember that the workflows presented here are merely examples of what’s possible—they are not hard-and-fast rules for using Git in the workplace. So, don't be afraid to adopt some aspects of a workflow and disregard others. The goal should always be to make Git work for you, not the other way around.
