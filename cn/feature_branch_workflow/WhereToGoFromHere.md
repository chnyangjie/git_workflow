# Where To Go From Here

For a walkthrough of feature branching on Bitbucket, check out the Using Git Branches documentation. By now, you can hopefully see how feature branches are a way to quite literally multiply the functionality of the single master branch used in the [Centralized Workflow](../centralized_workflow/). In addition, feature branches also facilitate pull requests, which makes it possible to discuss specific commits right inside of your version control GUI.

The Feature Branch Workflow is an incredibly flexible way to develop a project. The problem is, sometimes it’s too flexible. For larger teams, it’s often beneficial to assign more specific roles to different branches. The Gitflow Workflow is a common pattern for managing feature development, release preparation, and maintenance.
